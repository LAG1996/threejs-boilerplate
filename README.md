# THREEJS Boilerplate
Author: Luis Angel Garcia

This is just some boilerplate code that I find myself writing anytime I do project using threejs.

### Installation
Run in your terminal:
`npm i @movinglinguini/threejs-boilerplate`



### How to Build
Run in your terminal:
`npm run build`

It will output to `build/three-boilerplate.js` and `build/three.min.js`
